# Swun's programs

My own programs. Here I would list some programs, like C/C++, python, MS windows `.bat`, \*nix `.sh`, Matlab `.m`, and Mathematica `.m`. 
`./bat/` folder is of course for MS windows.
Other files from MS windows would start with a comment `for MS windows`, and with the name ended with `__MS`.
